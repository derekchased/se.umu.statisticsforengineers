1a. What does the variable agexpend tell us?
- this is government spending on agriculture.
- I believe this is a percentage
- I had to open the excel doc because on import, it was hard to read 
- I see now that the first 8 rows or so are oddly formatted in excel
1b. What does the value of the variable sanitaccess mean?
- This is access to sanitation
- Same comment as above
1c. What was the main source for the values of variable wateraccess?
- Access to drinking water??
- not sure about this one

# Part B - Cleaning and analyzing data
# -First of make the variable names the new headers of the dataset. 
# -Thereafter, you should remove the first 9 rows of the data set. 
# -Do also remove the last 5 rows as these are also irrelevant.

# Create new header - 9th row, all columns
#... actually since we used the readexcel function, it's the 8th row now
#... that function automatically the 1st row the header, so now the 1st row
#... is really the second row, etc
header_row = 8
header = excel_data[header_row,]
names(excel_data) = header

# Remove first 8 rows
excel_data_reduced = excel_data[-seq(1,8),]

# Remove last 4
excel_data_reduced_more = excel_data_reduced[-seq( nrow(excel_data_reduced)-3, nrow(excel_data_reduced)),]

# Compare the median water access between countries in Africa and outside Africa.
# Do this by creating a side by side boxplot (Add labels to create a nicer plot).
# PS. Donâ€™t forget to make the values numeric to be able to create a boxplot

# Find the mean water access of all the countries in Africa and compare

# mean and median? Explain shortly.

#Manipulating data
# Create a new variable in the data frame being the combined investment in

  #Hint: Use function hist to create a histogram.
